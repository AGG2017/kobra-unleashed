# Kobra Unleashed

Since the Kobra 2 Pro/Plus/Max do not have a webinterface built-in, I decided to create one myself. This is the result.

These printers sadly feature a closed source firmware, so it isn't easily possible to extend the existing firmware.
Using another firmware is theoretically possible but difficult, since a lot of modifications would be needed to make it
work.

## How does it work?

This webinterface uses the interface of the firmware that is designed to be used with the proprietary app of the
manufacturer. This interface is not documented and not officially supported. All controls and information used in the
webinterface are the result of reverse engineering.
